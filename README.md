When looking for a new job, recruiters would like to understand what projects I worked on as a designer and what value my work brought to the projects. When they get my CV, under the most important career steps they can find a link to a related project page of my portfolio. This helps them to dive deeper and find further information they need to make a decision on either hiring me or not.
